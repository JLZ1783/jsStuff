We need to loop through random sets of strings
grouped by 1000's to insert into a SQL Stored Proc
That communicates to a remote Oracle server 
via some version OpenQuery for cerner:

These groups will be inserted into a 
"WHERE <value> in (<our group>)"

Haven't decided on how we should interact 
the stored proc should~

Option 1:  We dynamically create the execute string using
the output from groupLoops.js

In this case we can take in the exec string 
then write to somewhere to be copy/pasted into SSMS.
